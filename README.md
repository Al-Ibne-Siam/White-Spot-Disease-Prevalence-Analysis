##
White Spot Disease (WSD) is a highly contagious viral infection that can lead to the rapid death of crustacean (shrimp, crab, prawn, etc.) populations. In our study, we implemented different machine-learning tools and algorithms to predict whether the prevalence of WSD in farmed shrimp will increase, decrease, or remain unchanged based on the features of shrimp farms in Bangladesh and their associated farming practices. We achieved an accuracy of 72.08%.

Furthermore, we used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) explainable AI to discover the effects of different farm features and practices on the change in prevalence, offering valuable insights into various trends in the data. Hence, this research has the potential to help minimize the prevalence of White Spot Disease in farmed shrimps in Bangladesh.
